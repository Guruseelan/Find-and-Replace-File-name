# Find-and-Replace-File-name
This was a project done to solve a specific problem for my institution.
    Many case we have to rename a bulk of file - like image file from mobile camera. in sequence 1,2,3,4....
Like wise my college has image files of students from various departments. 14ca1580,14ca1581....,16cse1001,16cse1002....
By specifying a matching case i'm renaming bluk of files as we are doing find and replace in notepad/ms-word.
Find:ca Replace:CA-  File renamed to 14CA-1580,14CA-1581.....
Also i added a delete option to delete bulk of files matching character sequence.
